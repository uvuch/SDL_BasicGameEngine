# SDL_BasicGameEngine

This project is a skeleton of a very simple SDL Game Engine and can be used as a template for a new game or application that uses SDL for its needs.

Another point of this project is to establish a playground for CMake. The goal is to be able to compile the code with CMake on MacOS, Linux, and Windows without the need to manually install any external library, such as SDL2, SDL2_TTF, SDL2_Image and etc.
